for c in df:
	print c # this c is actually col name

pd.concat((), axis=1) works for gluing many series together, but all components must be Series not DataFrame

df.apply(lambda x:....) works for apply some func for all columns
df + - * /= can be broadcast to Series, but it will incur __future__ warning that it's deprecated.
